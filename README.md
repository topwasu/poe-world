We introduce a novel program synthesis approach to output world models of complex, non-gridworld domains by representing world models as products of programmatic experts.

## Installation

First clone this project and cd to it 
```
git clone https://github.com/topwasu/poe-world.git
cd poe-world
```

Create conda environment 
```
conda create -n poeworld python=3.10
conda activate poeworld
```

Install requirements 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Initialize all submodules 
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install the submodule `openai-hf-interface` by calling 
```
cd openai-hf-interface
pip install -e .
# Important: you also need to create a file (secrets.json) containing your OpenAI's API key here -- see instruction below
cd ..
```
`openai-hf-interface` is a package that provides nice abstractions for calling OpenAI's api, so you need to input your OpenAI's API key. To do that, create a file called `secrets.json` inside `openai-hf-interface` directory and set the key called `openai_api_key` to your OpenAI's API key value. See [the package's repo](https://github.com/topwasu/openai-hf-interface) for more information.

Install the submodule OCAtari
```
cd OC_Atari
python setup.py develop 
pip install "gymnasium[atari, accept-rom-license]"
cd ..
```

## Example learned PoE-World world models

**mr_world_model_seed0.txt** and **pong_world_model_seed0.txt** contain learned PoE-World world models for Montezuma's Revenge and Pong, respectively.

## Important Files

**agents/agent.py**
Contains the implementation of the main agent class, which is responsible for interacting with the environment, calling planning algorithms, and calling functions to update world models.

**agents/mcts.py**
Implements the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, which is used by the agent to plan motions.

**classes/envs**
Contains the environment classes in the style of openai's gym

**classes/helper.py**
Contains various helper classes that are interfaces to game objects (Obj), their interactions (Interaction), game states (ObjList), etc.

**learners/world_model_learner.py**
Implements the world model learner, which calls the obj model learner for all object types.

**learners/obj_model_learner.py**
Implements the object model learner, which calls synthesizers to get programs and calls MoEObjModel in learners/models.py to fit the weights of the programs.

**learners/synthesizer.py**
Contains modules that synthesize programs based on observation

**learners/models.py**
Contains classes that let us fit the weights of the programs
